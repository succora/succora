	<p><strong>Please read these terms and conditions carefully before using the services offered by Succora.org.</strong> This Agreement describes the terms and conditions that govern your use of our services at http://succora.org (collectively "Site" or ?Platform?). You must read, agree with and accept all of the terms and conditions contained in this Agreement and our privacy policy before signing up to become a member of the site.</p>
	 
	<p>Succora is a platform where users ("Project creators") run campaigns to fund environmentally conscious projects by offering rewards to raise money from other users ("Backers"). Through the Site, email, websites, and other media, the Service makes accessible various content, including, but not limited to, videos, photographs, images, artwork, graphics, audio clips, comments, data, text, software, scripts, projects, other material and information, and associated trademarks and copyrightable works (collectively, ?Content?). Project Creators, Backers, and other visitors to and users of the Service (collectively, ?Users?) may have the ability to contribute, add, create, upload, submit, distribute, facilitate the distribution of, collect, post, or otherwise make accessible ("Submit") Content. ?User Submissions? means any Content Submitted by Users.</p>
	 
	<p>Projects. All funds are collected for Project Creators through the PayPal online payment service. Succora collects and transfers these funds to the Project Creator only if the project is successfully funded before the Project Deadline. Succora cannot be held liable for the actions of a Project Creator who are responsible for fulfilling obligations in any project listing they create. We do not oversee the performance of projects or their delivery. Succora reserves the right to cancel a project listing and refund all associated members' payments at any time for any reason. We reserve the right to remove a project listing from public listings for any reason. All interactions on the platform are solely between Creators and Backers, we are under no obligation to become involved in disputes between Project Backers and Project Creators, or between site members and any third party. In the event of a dispute, you release Succora employees, partners and successors in rights from claims, damages and demands of every kind, known or unknown, suspected or unsuspected, disclosed or undisclosed, arising out of or in any way related to such disputes and our service. We cannot guarantee the performance or reliability of the PayPal online payment service. Additionally, because of occasional failures of some credit cards, Pozible cannot guarantee the full receipt of the total funds pledged to a successful project. Project creators and Project supporters must also agree and comply with the PayPal Acceptable Use Policy.</p>
	 
	<p>Rewards. You must accurately describe your Rewards in your Project Description and the Reward description. By listing a Reward on the Site you agree that you have the rights to and may legally offer the Reward(s). Each Reward must accurately and completely describe the item(s) or experiences on offer as well as the quantity of rewards on offer. Each reward must exactly match its description, any reward that differs in any way requires a separate description. Policies such as shipping, returns, payment and selling policies made by Project Creators must be outlined to backers. Policies must be reasonable and Project creators must abide by such policies that they create. Project Creators are responsible for enforcing their own reasonable seller policies. Succora reserves the right to request that a Project Creator modify a seller policy. The Project creator is obligated to ship the Reward(s) or otherwise complete the transaction with the Project Supporter, unless there is an exceptional circumstance, such as: (a) the Project Supporter fails to meet the terms of the Project Creator's listing (such as payment method), or (b) the Project Creator cannot authenticate the Project Supporter's identity. The Project Supporter is obligated to deliver appropriate payment for Rewards purchased, unless there is an exceptional circumstance.</p>
	 
	<p>Personal conduct. You are responsible for all of your activity in connection with the Service. You shall not, and shall not permit any third party using your account to, take any action, or Submit Content.</p>
	 
	<p>Fees. It is free to join and create a project on Succora.org. However we do charge fees for some services. Our fees (along with any changes made to these fees) are posted on the site. We collect fees on Projects that are successfully funded through the platform. You are responsible for paying all fees and taxes associated with your use of the Service. If a project is successfully funded, Succora applies a 5% fee to the goal amount of the project. If a project collects more than the goal amount we will continue to charge fees on the goal amount (this is Succora's personal thank you and expression of good will to our customers. We reserve the right to change this policy at any time for any reason if we feel that project creators are misusing or abusing this system). If a project does not reach its funding goal by the assigned deadline the project is deemed unsuccessful. All transactions are cancelled and the project backers' pledges are returned. In this senario no fees or charges apply. Additional fees and charges from the third party payment processor may apply.</p>
	 
	<p>You and we are independent contractors, and nothing in this Agreement creates a partnership, employment relationship or agency. There are no third-party beneficiaries of this Agreement. You may not assign this Agreement or your rights and obligations hereunder, in whole or in part, to any third party without our prior written consent, and any attempt by you to do so will be invalid. Should any part of this Agreement be held invalid or unenforceable, that portion will be construed consistent with applicable law and the remaining portions will remain in full force and effect. Our failure to enforce any provision of this Agreement will not be considered a waiver of the right to enforce such provision. Our rights under this Agreement will survive any termination of this Agreement. Succora will not be liable for any delay or failure to provide its services caused by a factor outside Succora's reasonable control (including but not limited to any act of God, war, breakdown of plant, industrial dispute, electricity failure, governmental or legal restraint).</p>
